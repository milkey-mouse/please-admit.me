[H4X0R](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/h4x0r) is a simulation/game about Hollywood hacking. I made this game for a [DigiPen](https://www.digipen.edu/) [ProjectFUN](https://academy.digipen.edu/projectfun-workshops/summer-workshops/) class. Part of the idea was to create a fake ecosystem of websites and commands: the player would have to visit StackUnderflow™ to find out how to use Doors™ BlueShell™, etc. Not enough content could be generated in the two weeks of the course, especially after I essentially implemented an entire (fake) window manager, shell, and terminal. At the time I thought about using neural networks such as [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) to generate entire fake posts, profile pictures, and other content à la [This Question Does Not Exist](https://stackroboflow.com/), but at the time the state of the art was not convincing or very fun for a human to read through.

These screenshots are from the DigiPen version of the game, written in Java:

Later I started work on a JS/HTML5 port of the game to improve my TypeScript/JavaScript skills, accessibility to players, and to ensure I, not DigiPen, held the rights to it. The furthest I got was the main menu & the game's intro:
