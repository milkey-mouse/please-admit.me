To put it succinctly[^words], [`swood`](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/swood) lets you turn this:

More technically, `swood` is a command-line sample-based software synthesizer (though not without [custom hardware](./2016-09-17-swood-box.md) to match). As described on [its homepage](https://meme.institute/swood):

*`swood` (or `swood.exe`) is a program for automatically tuning audio samples to different frequencies. It works as a MIDI synthesizer, which can be used to process audio in realtime (like the [Casio SK-5](https://youtu.be/kIGItPElleo?t=14s)) or convert [MIDIs](https://youtu.be/SUUxmJ84dnI) directly into [WAV files](https://youtu.be/3FonZ2x7u-s?t=1m25s).*

*One could use this for real music, but the main purpose is for meme remixes like [Robotniktrousle](https://youtu.be/NbqkPbr_yVc) or [ECCH by Glamour](https://youtu.be/oQWMEgq1vhE?t=8s). In the past, this has been done by extracting sound clips from obscure terrible animated movies/TV shows/YouTube videos (like [Hotel Mario](https://youtu.be/1f3Kq7Fw0TY)) and painstakingly rearranging them one-by-one in a video editor. This is hard work! Where `swood` comes in is by taking in the video clips and a MIDI and spitting out [zero-effort mememixes](https://soundcloud.com/silly-stix).*

While testing `swood` I created a [SoundCloud account](https://soundcloud.com/silly-stix) where I dumped my tests. Each and every song on it was created with no more than `swood` and sometimes [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), and all were created in less than five minutes.

I had [a prototype of `swood`](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/swood/blob/895327e3879b3ad1dfdc622c319e3aa8d7183e80/swood.py) working in less than a day with barely 100 lines of code; the current version has thousands of lines of code, is an order of magnitude faster, and took more than six months of work (counting the [hardware](./2016-09-17-swood-box.md)).

`swood` was one of the first "real" applications I had developed from scratch, [tested](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/swood/tree/master/tests), [documented](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/swood/wiki/How-to-use-swood), [packaged](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/swood/commit/af88c4858b3a07f68caf0073521438c30cbfa257), [released](https://pypi.org/project/swood/), [maintained](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/swood/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), and [updated](https://pypi.org/project/swood/#history). To this day I find despite its silliness it's one of the most useful tools I have ever made. I have probably used `swood` for at least ten separate audiovisual projects.

**After I created `swood` I wanted to show it off at [Maker Faire](https://seattle.makerfaire.com/), but being software there was nothing to show! That's why I made a [custom physical synthesizer](./2016-09-17-swood-box.md) powered by `swood`.**
