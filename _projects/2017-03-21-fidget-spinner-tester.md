TODO

Unfortunately I never did bring it to school because as a friend pointed out after its completion, I "couldn't have made it look more like a bomb if I had tried."

As I put it [on Hackaday.IO](https://hackaday.io/project/20485-fidget-spinner-tester):

*"Fidget spinners" are all the rage at my school; ever since they got a 3D printer the students were allowed to use, people have been printing hundreds of these little trinkets, with one skate bearing in the middle to make it spin & three more as weight to increase the inertia. (The picture to the left is an example of one.) People have been "battling" with them like Beyblades by hitting a finger against the side and timing the spin. That's not an objective enough test for me, so I'm building a machine that spins them up for a constant amount of time & times how long they take to come to a complete stop.*
