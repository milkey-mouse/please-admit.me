[JSSCC](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/JSSCC) is a JavaScript (technically [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) recreation of the 8-bit[^1] software synthesizer GXSCC.

[GXSCC](https://meme.institute/gxscc) is a software synthesizer designed to simulate several classic "8-bit" sound chips such as the [NES APU](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU) and the [SCC](https://www.msx.org/wiki/SCC) (hence the name):

I never finished this project for technical reasons, as I summed up [here](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/JSSCC/issues/4). I worked on on the UI first, and ended up with a nearly pixel-perfect recreation of the original GXSCC. Unfortunately I had a pixel-perfect recreation of the original GXSCC. In my quest for pixel perfection I forewent HTML and CSS for the layout and used the immediate-mode ([`Canvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) in this case) rendering I was used to in normal desktop C or C++ applications. This made the UI not scalable and slow (what's fast and normal in C was less so in JavaScript), not to mention the impact on accessibility and more obscure features like tabbing between elements. I had to resort to [weird optimizations](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/JSSCC/commit/40b559f9c5ad4f0103aa2885598b77bd388e7fb0) to keep a smooth 60 FPS, whereas the original GXSCC could run easily on computers built in 2000. Realizing I'd have to start essentially from scratch to do it correctly (and remembering I kind of hate web development), I [abandoned the project](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/JSSCC/issues/4) before even wiring up [the actual synthesizer](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/JSSCC/blob/2607684460dfdb00a468a3ee7364959da44d52c0/src/song.ts) to the [WebAudio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

Nevertheless, you can try out JSSCC in its current state [here](https://milkey-mouse.github.io/JSSCC/).

JSSCC also includes multiple color palettes/themes, a feature not present in GXSCC.
