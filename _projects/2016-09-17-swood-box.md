My initial design for the box was a lot smaller; I wanted to cram everything on top of a normal Raspberry Pi case. This was deemed unreasonable when the button & microphone wouldn't fit on the top, and more importantly, the button was too tall internally for the lid to close. By modelling my design before building it I could discover this flaw beforehand.

## Maker Faire

As someone interested in hardware, DIY, programming, and other things that fall under the umbrella of "making," I was going to [Seattle Mini Maker Faire](https://seattle.makerfaire.com/) regardless of my project's acceptance. Eventually I was [accepted](https://seattle.makerfaire.com/about-2/2016-archive/make-music-with-any-sound/) to present swood at Maker Faire, which was awesome, but put me in a bit of a time crunch. I was making changes to the [software](./2016-03-21-swood.md) & hardware not just down to the last hours before the Faire, but in between days of the event as well.

Fortunately swood already worked pretty well as pure software; my main worries were that something would break in the hardware (I was very careful loading my equipment into and out of the car!) or, even worse, something would go wrong with the "UI" or other code interfacing swood with the buttons, lights, microphone, speaker, and sensors on the device. I had spares for almost every component with me during the Faire, and I even spent some extra time setting up the Raspberry Pi to mount its root filesystem as read-only so in case of a software glitch I could simply pull the plug and [turn it off and on again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k&t=3).

I was worried about a Murphy's Law scenario: anything that could go wrong, would. Ironically after preparing so many contingencies everything went off without a hitch and I brought home my spare parts bin no lighter than when taken in.

## Panel

Before Maker Faire, I was contacted by one of the organizers about participating in their [Youth Makers panel](https://seattle.makerfaire.com/about-2/2016-archive/youth-maker-spotlight/). I said yes, and I got to show off swood in front of a large audience at the EMP. My favorite part of this whole project was when I was answering questions from the audience and a little kid requested an encore with swood. (I obliged, of course.)
